Kiara
=====

My fork of [kiara](https://github.com/hartfelt/kiara/), optimized for use with Kodi, with AniDB scrapper.

Files are renamed to the following format: `anime_name - epXX - episode_name - [group_name].ext`

That is applied to all types of anime (movie, ova, etc), with the exception of special episodes, where the `epXX` is replaced with `s00eXX`. Movies can still be sorted to separate folders, but the format is still necessary for Kodi's scrapper to recognize the files.

***

Kiara will hash your anime and add the episode to your anidb mylist.
It will also mark those files watched, and organize them nicely in folders.

Requirements
------------
Python 3.2 (or newer)
colorama (optional) - if you want colored output

------------
1. `sudo python3 setup.py install`
2. See /etc/kiararc for further instructions
